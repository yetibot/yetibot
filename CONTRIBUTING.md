# Yetibot :heart: PRs

Before adding to Yetibot you might want to check with the author first to see
if:

1. the feature makes sense for Yetibot
1. whether it should be in `yetibot` or `yetibot.core`
1. no one is [working on it already](https://waffle.io/devth/yetibot)

When ready to contribute:

1. Fork the repo
1. Add your contributions on the `master` branch of your fork as logically
   grouped commits with [well-formed commit
   messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
1. Rebase on upstream master if it changed
1. Open a PR

## Tests

Tests are appreciated, especially when there's logic beyond a simple API call.

## Style

Please adhere to yetibot's existing conventions:

- 2 spaces
- no lines beyond 80 characters wide
- no trailing whitespace
